# VRCPixelColor

VRCPixelColor is a Unity tool for VRChat worlds that dynamically applies pixel color data from a [VideoTXL](https://github.com/vrctxl/VideoTXL) video player to lights, materials, particles, and [VRCLightVolumes](https://github.com/REDSIM/VRCLightVolumes) in real time. Designed for immersive and responsive environments.
